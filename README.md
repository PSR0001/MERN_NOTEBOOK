### **Why Express ?**
[**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular [**Node web frameworks**](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/frameworks.html). It provides mechanisms to:

- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
- Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

we are using **Express** for ```http``` request , Serving the Webpages.
